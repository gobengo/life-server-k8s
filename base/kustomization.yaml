# We need to provide a custom config.json because the default one sets values
# that are different than the usual solid cli defaults, e.g. it sets multiuser=true instead of false.
# And (I think) the config file takes precedence over environment variables, or at least it's not possible to set multiuser=false via env variable after that.
# So here we'll set an empty config.json, then use only environment variables to configure things.
